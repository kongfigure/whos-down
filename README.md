# Who's Down
Find your people. Make plans happen.

## Inspiration
Everyone wants to hang out -- but no one wants to initiate.
Balancing busy schedules, anxiety, and group chat chaos, spontaneous hangouts are getting harder.
We built **Who's Down** to make it effortless to say **"I'm Down!"** to plans, and instantly connect with people nearby.

## What It Does

- Allows others to tap on a button to join in real time
- Suggests nearby spots depending on the user using Google Maps API
